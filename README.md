## Current Progress
| Game | Progress info |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Sugary Spire Exhibition Night | 80% done. 60 fps 75% of the time. Needs more optimizsation for v1 switches, more sounds implemented, and achievement menu text fixed up. Besides that fully playable and can be completed to 100%|
| Sugary Spire Demo 1 | 97% done. Runs 60fps all the time, only issues are no saving and a crash in mines when exiting the dark section (both easy fixes)|
| Sugary Spire P rank build (also known as the march build) | 30% done. Runs 60fps most of the time, crashes constantly, no levels beatable besides crunchy construction and no saving (savings an easy fix)|
| Pizza Tower Sage 19 Plus | 5% done. boots, runs around 20fps on the mainmenu crashing after leaving on switch and crashes after the tutorial on pc|
| Pizza Tower Fighters | 75% done. 60fps 100% of the time, cpu battles work, 2p mode controller pairings are buggy (only use half joy-con)|
| Undertale Yellow | ?% done. 60fps, unknown whats working due to the second lava ball puzzle broken due to broken collisions with the moving platforms leading to a softlock. All of ruins and the battle system works however.|
| Super Bo Noise | 75% done. 60fps - 30fps, text system fully works, no known crashes due to a lack of testing, no sound or saving.|
