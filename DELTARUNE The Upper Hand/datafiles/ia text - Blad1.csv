,* I mean... €€€€€€YEAH! €€€Of course we can!
,* A lighthouse that size can't be good for a darkworld.
,"* But if we turn it off, €€€€€€@it could save everyone!"

,"* Well you see, €€€€€€Darkners shouldn't be exposed to LIGHT."
,* When a fountain clouds the world in darkness-
,* Us darkeners €€€€€€spring to life!
,* Lightness €€€€€€however...
,* Disrupts €€€€€€a darkener's physical €€€€€€and mental capabilities.
,"* If exposed to light, €€€€€€a darkener could suffer dizziness, €€€€€€paralysis..."
,AND MEMORY LOSS...
,THAT'S WHY €€€€€€THE SOCKS DON'T REBELL.
,THEY CAN'T REMEMBER €€€€€€WHO THEY USED TO BE.
,AND €€€€€€€€€€€€ME AND £LIL' BUDDY...
,CAN'T €€€€€€€€€REMEMBER WHO WE WERE €€€€€€€EITHER.
,"OUR FRIENDS, €€€€€€€€O-€€€€OUR MIND, €€€€OUR LIFE?"
,WE CAN'T REMEMBER ANY OF IT.
,ALL BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT...
,WONDER WHAT IT WAS LIKE...
,* Then it sounds like we've got work to do.
,"* If that lighthouse is such a problem, €€€€€€we'll SMASH IT TO BITS!"
,* Sounds like a plan.
,"* And, €€€€€€call it a hunch..."
,* But if we can release all that energy back into the world-
,* You €€€€€€and your people could get your memories back.
,Y-€€€€YOU REALLY THINK THAT COULD WORK?
,"* It's worth a shot, €€€€€€right?"
,* We'll show that eggface who's REALLY in charge!!!
,Y-€€€YEAH! €€€€€€€YEAH!!!

,* You can't do this by yourself...
,

,* But if we want to get through this...
,* We have to work as a team!

,"* No, €€€€€€no..."
,* What you three have shown me was...
,* Much €€€€€€€€€more valuable...
,* I'll never have my old memories back...
,* But the new memories I made with you?
,"* ...I've never felt more like myself, €€€€€€then during our time spent together."
,* If you can promise me you'll stick together...
,* You'll never forget who you are.
,* Here... €€€€€€with my last memories...
,* Allow me to strengthen your bond.

,* Sorry it had to turn out this way...
,* Something tells me it didn't matter anyway.
,* Our time spent together was the most free I've felt.
,* And you three will shine brightly all the same.
,* Here... €€€€€€with my last memories...
,* Allow me to strengthen your bond.
